# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict credit card approval probability. The data is processed using Pandas, visualized with Matplotlib/Seaborn, and then multiple classification models (such as Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost) are trained. The models are optimized using GridSearchCV to achieve the highest accuracy.
